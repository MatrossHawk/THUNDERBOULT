Welcome! This repository showcases my journey as a dedicated problem solver focused on medium-level Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges. Here you'll find well-documented solutions to a variety of classic and unique problems drawn from platforms like LeetCode, with a strong emphasis on:

Array and number manipulation

Advanced linked list techniques

Recursion and backtracking algorithms
Tree and Binary search Tree PROBLEMS

Each solution demonstrates clear logic, efficient code, and thoughtful analysis of edge scenariosâ€”particularly in recursion, backtracking, and special string operations. My goal is to not only provide correct implementations but also share insights that can help others deepen their DSA understanding and prepare for competitive programming or technical interviews.
